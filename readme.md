to do list:
setup git on computer in lab to allow for merges without needing new install
probably create a setup txt file for any future users, should likely include python 3 / pip install, "pip install opencv-python", and "pip install xarm-python-sdk", reduces confusion

will review code and create a txt file with unused functions, if it has not been done already
